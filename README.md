# Hellscape
Hellscape O'Fallon is a turn-based RPG terminal game that I created for an Object Based Programming project.


This project demonstrates my knowledge of object oriented programming, including the use of the inheritence property, methods, and attributes.
Additionally, I had to call upon a wide array of other Python skills in creating this project including the use of strings, lists, loops, and functions.
